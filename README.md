# IMDb-SQL-Project

The IMDb Project is to implement and practice everything I learned from the course by incorporating some of my own questions to obtain the results.
Throughout this project, I applied various SQL techniques such as Aggregation, Joins, CTEâ€™s, Window Function, Procedures, Views, Case Statement, Row_Number, Partition By and Group By.
